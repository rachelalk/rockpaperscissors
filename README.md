<h1> Rock, paper, scissors </h1>

<h2> Main learning points: </h2>

<ul>
  <li> This was our first School of Code project. 
    <li> During this task, the steps were already semi broken down for us which made it much easier to follow and made the task feel manageable.
      <li> Having the steps highlighted the importance of breaking down a task and demonstrated what could be achieved with a series of small steps.
    <li> We made use of the limited Javascript that we learnt in week 1 (2 days of learning and workshops), followed the steps and created a functional rock, paper, scissors game which felt like a real achievement as this is was first functional project I'd made.
    <li> We made use of prompt(), alert() and confirm(). Prompt() was to take the user's name as input and use it to personalise the game throughout, we used alert() to provide accurate scoring to for the user to see at the end of every round and we used confirm() to check if the user wanted to play another round or quit.
      <li> We used math.floor() in conjunction with math.random() and an array in order to generate a random computer outcome, allowing the user to play against the computer.
        <li> If statements were used to generate an outcome of each game, the outcome was saved to a variable which was called upon for scoring.
          <li> I was really please with how this turned out, having completed the task within 1 day and this being my first attempt at a hackathon.
            </ul>
